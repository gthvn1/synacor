- The [Synacor Challenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20230206005149/https://challenge.synacor.com/) is a fun online coding challenge.
- The original website isn’t available anymore.
- I found out about it through [stewSquared's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stewSquared).
- This is a great way to practice and learn Rust while solving the challenge.
